# Project Overview

## admin
Directory containing the voluntary teaching assignment.
## annealing
Package containing the annealing / simulated annealing algorithms that serve as placeholders for quantum computers. Counterintuitive, also contains Tabu Search

## benchmark
Package with benchmark instances. 

## experiments_archive

Archive for experiments leading to the finale result. Each sub-directory is a wrapper for experiments concerning a specific subject / topic, 
with its experiments as jupyter notebook files. 

## literatur
Archiv for literatur used throught the thesis. (Some of it)

## meetings
Some meetings protocols written down when they where important

## plotter
Small helper functions to plot data of the algorithm

## protocols
Some summarys of what happend in a time interval. Like a journal.

## qhea

Code of final result.
Package with all code needed  for the Quantum-Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm.
For example usage, refer to example.py in the root folder.


## thesis
final thesis

## tsp_qubo

Package that provides quick access for example TSP QUBO instances.
The QUBO Matrix returned implements all penalties. However, a user
might want to generate his own TSP QUBO and set his own Lagrange Coefficients.
For example usage refer to the example.py in the root folder of this project. 


## util

Package that provides utility functions for generating arrays / vectors and matrices.
